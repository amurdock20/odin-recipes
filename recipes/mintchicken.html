     <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p>
<h2>Ingriedients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup margarine</li>
    <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flower just to coat, and shake off the excess.</li>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
