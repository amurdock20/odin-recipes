        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a heavy skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke. Place shrimp in an even layer on the bottom of the pan and cook for 1 minute without stirring.</li>
            <h3>Step 2</h3>
            <li>Season shrimp with salt; cook and stir until shrimp begin to turn pink, about 1 minute.</li>
            <h3>Step 3</h3>
            <li>Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir for 1 minute.</li>
            <h3>Step 4</h3>
            <li>Stir in lemon juice, caper brine, 1 piece of butter, and 1/2 of the parsley; cook until butter has melted, about 1 minute</li>
            <h3>Step 5</h3>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in remaining 3 pieces butter. Cook and stir until butter has melted, sauce is thick, and shrimp are pink and opaque, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <h3>Step 6</h3>
            <li>Remove shrimp with a slotted spoon and transfer to a bowl; continue to cook butter sauce, adding water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if too thick, about 2 minutes. Season with salt to taste; serve shrimp topped with the pan sauce and remaining parsley.</li>
